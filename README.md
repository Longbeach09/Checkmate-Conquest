CheckMate Conquest 

CheckMate Conquest is a fully functional chess application where you can play locally

With this app you can log in and store your user in a psql database and play chess with a friend locally the board flips so if your playing on the same computer one of your friends doesnt have to be looking upside down I used two libraries to help which are the chess.js library and the react dnd library to help move things arouns and keep them inside the boards square. All of the advanced moves like castling and En Passent work as well.
